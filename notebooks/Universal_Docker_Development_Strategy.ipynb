    "The Universal Docker Development Strategy solves common development challenges:\n",
    "- ❌ **Dependency conflicts** between projects\n",
    "- ❌ **Environment setup complexity** for new team members  \n",
    "- ❌ **Version mismatches** across development machines\n",
    "- ❌ **\"Works on my machine\"** deployment issues\n",
    "- ❌ **Time-consuming environment configuration**\n",
