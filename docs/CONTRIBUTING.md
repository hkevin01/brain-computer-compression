# Contributing to BCI Compression Toolkit

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Brain-Computer Interface Data Compression Toolkit! This is an individual research project exploring neural data compression techniques, and community contributions are welcome.

*Note: This project was developed with assistance from Claude AI for algorithm implementation and documentation.*

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git knowledge
- Familiarity with neural data or compression algorithms
- Understanding of brain-computer interfaces (helpful but not required)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/brain-computer-compression.git
cd brain-computer-compression
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Code Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 for code formatting
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Maximum line length: 79 characters
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Documentation
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Include parameter types and descriptions
- Provide usage examples where appropriate
- Reference relevant research papers in comments

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure test coverage > 90%
- Test with both synthetic and real neural data
- Include performance benchmarks

## Compression Algorithm Contributions

When contributing new compression algorithms:

1. **Inherit from BaseCompressor**: All algorithms should inherit from the `BaseCompressor` class
2. **Implement required methods**: `compress()`, `decompress()`, and optionally `fit()`
3. **Optimize for neural data**: Consider temporal correlations and multi-channel structure
4. **Document performance**: Include compression ratio, latency, and quality metrics
5. **Add benchmarks**: Include the algorithm in benchmark comparisons

### Example Algorithm Structure

```python
from bci_compression.core import BaseCompressor
import numpy as np

class MyCompressionAlgorithm(BaseCompressor):
    """
    Brief description of the algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    param1 : type
        Description of parameter.
    """

    def __init__(self, param1: int = 10):
        super().__init__()
        self.param1 = param1

    def compress(self, data: np.ndarray) -> bytes:
        """Compress neural data."""
        # Implementation here
        pass

    def decompress(self, compressed_data: bytes) -> np.ndarray:
        """Decompress neural data."""
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
