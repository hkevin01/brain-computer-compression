# Potential Spin-Off Projects

Here are several ideas for spin-offs that can multiply the impact of the brain-computer-compression project:

| Spin-Off Idea                     | Description                                                                 | Humanitarian Benefit                                                      |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Open-Source BCI Data Platform     | Build a platform for sharing, compressing, and analyzing neural datasets.   | Enables global collaboration, accelerates research, and aids in reproducibility. |
| Real-Time BCI Communication App   | Use your compression algorithms to enable faster, lower-latency BCI communication tools (e.g., for locked-in patients). | Improves quality of life for people with severe disabilities.              |
| BCI for Low-Bandwidth Environments| Adapt your compression for use in areas with poor internet infrastructure (e.g., remote clinics). | Expands access to neurotechnology in underserved regions.                  |

## Next Steps

- **Focus:** Prioritize brain-computer-compression for development, documentation, and outreach.
- **Community:** Seek collaborators from neuroscience, medicine, and humanitarian tech.
- **Visibility:** Write a blog post or preprint about the projectâ€™s societal potential. Engage with open BCI and assistive tech communities.
