## Test Plan Update (2025-07-19)

### Phase 8: Advanced Neural Compression - âœ… COMPLETED
- 18/18 Phase 8 tests passing (unit, integration, performance)
- 100% coverage for transformer and VAE modules
- All algorithms validated via factory and registry
- Memory, latency, and quality metrics tested

---

### Phase 9: Hardware Optimizations - ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS

#### Test Strategy
- **Unit Tests**
  - [ ] SIMD/AVX/CUDA/FPGA kernel correctness (ARM, x86, GPU, FPGA)
  - [ ] Platform-specific edge cases
- **Integration Tests**
  - [ ] End-to-end compression/decompression on all hardware
  - [ ] Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, browser)
- **Performance Tests**
  - [ ] Benchmark speedup vs. baseline (CPU, GPU, FPGA)
  - [ ] Latency and throughput for real-time streaming
  - [ ] Power consumption on mobile/embedded
- **Deployment Tests**
  - [ ] Docker, WASM, REST API integration
  - [ ] CI/CD pipeline for all targets
  - [ ] Automated regression and benchmarking
- **Quality/Robustness**
  - [ ] Fault tolerance under hardware failure
  - [ ] Consistency across platforms and builds

#### New Test Cases
- [ ] ARM NEON SIMD: Validate output, speed, and power
- [ ] Intel AVX/AVX2: Validate output, speed, and power
- [ ] CUDA: Validate output, speed, and power
- [ ] FPGA: Validate output, speed, and power
- [ ] WASM: Browser-based compression/decompression
- [ ] Docker: Containerized deployment tests
- [ ] REST API: Remote compression tests
- [ ] Cross-platform: Linux, Windows, macOS, Android
- [ ] Power/thermal: Mobile and embedded profiling

#### CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Automated builds and tests for all hardware targets
- [ ] Benchmarking and reporting in CI pipeline
- [ ] Test logs and artifacts for all platforms

#### Success Criteria
- All hardware-optimized modules pass unit/integration/performance tests
- â‰¥2x speedup on target hardware vs. baseline
- <10ms latency for real-time streaming
- <10% power overhead on mobile
- All deployment artifacts validated
- 100% test coverage for new modules
