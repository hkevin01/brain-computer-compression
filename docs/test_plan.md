# Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the Brain-Computer Compression project. The goal is to ensure the reliability, correctness, and robustness of all core components, algorithms, and data processing pipelines.

## Phased Testing Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Foundation**
- [ ] Set up test infrastructure (pytest, flake8, coverage)
- [ ] Write basic unit tests for utility functions and data structures
- [ ] Validate data loading and synthetic data generation

### **Phase 2: Algorithms**
- [ ] Unit tests for all main compressors (lossless, lossy, neural, GPU, predictive)
- [ ] Test shape/dtype integrity and error handling in compressors
- [ ] Regression tests for previously fixed bugs in algorithms

### **Phase 3: Integration**
- [ ] End-to-end tests for compression/decompression pipelines
- [ ] Integration tests for data processing modules (filters, signal processing)
- [ ] Test fallback and logging mechanisms

### **Phase 4: Fault Tolerance & Performance**
- [ ] Simulate errors, missing dependencies, and corrupted data
- [ ] Performance and benchmarking tests (speed, memory, compression ratio)
- [ ] Usability tests for CLI/GUI workflows (optional)

## Objectives
- Validate correctness of all compression and decompression algorithms.
- Ensure data integrity and error handling across all modules.
- Achieve high code coverage for critical paths.
- Automate testing and reporting for continuous integration.

## Test Types
- **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions and classes (e.g., compressors, data processors).
- **Integration Tests:** Validate interactions between modules (e.g., end-to-end compression/decompression, pipeline execution).
- **Regression Tests:** Prevent reintroduction of previously fixed bugs.
- **Performance Tests:** Benchmark speed, memory usage, and compression ratios.
- **Fault Tolerance Tests:** Simulate errors, missing dependencies, and corrupted data.
- **Usability Tests:** (Optional) Validate CLI/GUI workflows and user documentation.

## Test Coverage
- All main and advanced compressors (lossless, lossy, neural, GPU, predictive, etc.).
- Data processing modules (filters, signal processing, synthetic data).
- Error handling, logging, and fallback mechanisms.
- Edge cases (empty data, extreme values, shape/dtype mismatches).

## Tools & Frameworks
- **pytest:** Main test runner for Python code.
- **flake8:** Linting and style checks.
- **coverage.py:** Code coverage analysis.
- **Continuous Integration:** (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) for automated test runs.

## Automation
- All tests should be runnable via a single command (e.g., `pytest`).
- Linting and coverage checks integrated into CI pipeline.
- Test failures and coverage reports should be visible in pull requests.

## Reporting
- Test results and coverage summaries are generated after each run.
- Critical failures and regressions are highlighted in CI.
- Manual test results (if any) are documented in this file or linked reports.

## Maintenance
- Update tests with new features or refactors.
- Remove obsolete tests and add new ones for bug fixes.
- Periodically review coverage and test effectiveness.
