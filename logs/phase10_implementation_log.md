# Phase 10 Implementation Log: Real-Time Visualization & Monitoring
**Date**: 2025-07-20
**Phase**: 10 - Real-Time Visualization & Monitoring
**Status**: ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS

## Overview
Implementing a comprehensive real-time visualization and monitoring system for the BCI compression toolkit, including web dashboard, live metrics, alert system, and system health monitoring.

## Objectives
- Web dashboard for real-time signal visualization and compression monitoring
- Live metrics display (compression ratio, latency, SNR, power consumption)
- Alert system for quality degradation and artifact detection
- System health monitoring (memory usage, GPU utilization, error rates)
- Seamless integration with compression pipeline

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Web Dashboard Framework
- [ ] Flask/FastAPI backend for real-time data serving
- [ ] WebSocket support for live data streaming
- [ ] React/Vue.js frontend for interactive visualization
- [ ] Real-time plotting with Plotly/D3.js

### 2. Live Metrics System
- [ ] Compression performance metrics collection
- [ ] Real-time latency monitoring
- [ ] Signal quality assessment (SNR, PSNR)
- [ ] Power consumption tracking

### 3. Alert System
- [ ] Quality degradation detection
- [ ] Artifact detection alerts
- [ ] System performance warnings
- [ ] Configurable alert thresholds

### 4. System Health Monitoring
- [ ] Memory usage tracking
- [ ] GPU utilization monitoring
- [ ] Error rate tracking
- [ ] Performance bottleneck detection

### 5. Integration Framework
- [ ] Compression pipeline integration
- [ ] Real-time data streaming
- [ ] Configuration management
- [ ] Logging and debugging tools
