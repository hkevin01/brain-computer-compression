# Implementation Change Log - 2025-07-21

## Modularity & Maintainability Improvements

- Planned and started refactor for plugin/entry-point extensibility (algorithms, data formats)
- Centralizing shared utilities (metrics, logging, config parsing)
- Ensuring all modules use unified logging and config management
- Expanding type hints and Google-style docstrings across codebase
- Automating test output logging and coverage reporting in CI/CD
- Updating and unifying documentation and usage examples
- All changes and test outputs are logged in the logs/ folder for traceability

- Reviewed and prepared .gitignore and config files for new modules and logs

## [2025-07-21] Plugin Registration and Test Run
- Attempted to register NeuralLZ77Compressor and NeuralArithmeticCoder as plugins (edit model did not apply changes; manual intervention may be needed)
- Ran full test suite after plugin refactor; 82/83 tests passed, 1 CUDA hardware test failed (expected on non-GPU systems)
- Test output logged to logs/test_output_2025-07-21_plugin_refactor.log for review

- Test failed: only 'dummy_lz' plugin is registered, not 'adaptive_lz' or 'dictionary'
- Indicates plugin registration for real algorithms is still pending manual intervention
- Test output logged to logs/test_api_plugins.log for review

## [2025-07-21] package.json Update
- Removed unused fetch-plugins script (no such script exists)
- Updated description to mention FastAPI backend and plugin API endpoint
- Confirmed scripts and dependencies for dashboard/backend integration are up to date
- No new tests run for this change

## [2025-07-21] Dashboard Plugin Selection Feature

## [2025-07-21] Dashboard Live Metrics Feature
- Updated dashboard to fetch and display live metrics from the backend /metrics endpoint
- No new backend or test changes for this feature

## [2025-07-21] Full Test Suite Run
- Ran full test suite after recent dashboard/backend and config changes
- 2 failures: plugin endpoint missing real plugins, CUDA driver error (expected on non-GPU systems)
- 9 tests passed before stopping after 2 failures
- Test output logged to logs/test_output_2025-07-21_full.log for review
- Manual plugin registration for real algorithms is still pending

## [2025-07-21] package.json Update
- Added dashboard build script (npm run build in dashboard/)
- Updated description to mention live metrics and real-time dashboard integration
- Confirmed scripts and dependencies for full-stack development are up to date

## [2025-07-21] Dashboard Real-Time Metrics Polling
- Enhanced dashboard LiveMetrics component to poll the backend /metrics endpoint every 3 seconds for live updates

## Modularity & Maintainability Improvements

- Planned and started refactor for plugin/entry-point extensibility (algorithms, data formats)
- Centralizing shared utilities (metrics, logging, config parsing)
- Ensuring all modules use unified logging and config management
- Expanding type hints and Google-style docstrings across codebase
