"""
Spike detection and compression for neural action potentials.
Implements threshold-based spike detection and template matching.

Example:
    >>> compressor = SpikeCompressor(threshold=4.5)
    >>> compressed = compressor.compress(signal)
    >>> reconstructed = compressor.decompress(compressed)
